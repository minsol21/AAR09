In this code, we have 6 tiles in the tile world. Out of total 100 steps, we include 30 steps of exploration to predict our robot from staying at the end of the world while decreasing uncertainty as much as it can. From the plot, we can see that robot has correctly predicted tiles with almost 0 variance.
